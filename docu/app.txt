The line app = Flask(__name__) creates a Flask object https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/api/#flask.Flask.
We then use the route() decorator to tell Flask which URL should trigger which function. It to binds functions to a URLs.

routes: TODO
/add-dog/: ...
/dog/<dog_name>/: ...

error handler: We create an errorhandler for the application. Every time an
Exception is raised in a request, the error handler checks if it is a
ValidationError. In positive case, the response status code is 400 to show the
client that the error is not in the application, but in the input. Otherwise,
the status returned is 500.

tests:
Notice that there is a pytest fixture to be used as a client making requests.
app.config is a dictionary and "TESTING", when True, makes Exceptions to be
propagated rather than handled by the the appâ€™s error handlers. Then a test
client is created using app.test_client(). The client has methods that match the
common HTTP request methods, such as client.get() and client.post(). They take
many arguments for building the request; you can find the full documentation in
https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/test/#werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder
. The test client is yielded as the fixture value for use in tests. When you run
test_app.py, the fixture client will be called once per test function.
In other words, the fixture will be executed before each test function in the
test module. This ensures that each test function has its own fresh instance of
the test client.

test_add_dog_bad_request: Makes sure that in case of bad request, the app returns
response with status 400 instead of 500.

test_add_dog: executes the /add-dog/ post request with some data given (to be the
Dog attributes). The request is called by the test client. Normally, when
we call post from the requests library, the url and data are enough. But in this
case, the client is created by the app, so the base url is somehow implicit. One
needs the endpoint, data but also validates the response json against the Dog.json schema.

test_get_dog_name: executes the /dog/<dog_name>/ get request from the test client
and validates the response json against the Dog.json schema.
