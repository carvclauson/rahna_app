Documentation about the queries classes in queries.py and tests

Goal: command and query classes work as a cover for the backend dog.py. The idea is that
the api is going to have access to command and query classes but not to dog.py

QUERIES LIST:

1. ListDogsQuery

When the API makes a request for listing all the dogs from a database, an instance of ListDogsQuery is created. The object has no attributes but has a method execute, which is called upon request.

Testing:

-test_list_dogs() instantiates two dogs and adds to the temporary database. Calls the method execute from ListDogsQuery and asserts that the returned list has length 2.

2. GetDogByIDQuery

When the API makes a request for retrieving a dog from a database by id, an instance of GetDogByIDQuery is created. The object has an id attribute carrying the id of the dog to be retrieved and a method execute, which is called upon request.

Testing:
-test_get_dog_by_id() instantiates a dog, which internally creates an id. GetDogByIDQuery is instantiated using this id and we make sure the returned dog by execute has the same id.

3. GetDogByNameQuery

Analogous to GetDogByIDQuery
