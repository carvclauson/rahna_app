Documentation about the command classes in commands.py and tests
################################################################

Goal: command and query classes work as a cover for the backend dog.py. The idea is that
the api is going to have access to command and query classes but not to dog.py

COMMANDS LIST:

1. AddDogCommand

When the API makes a request for adding a Dog to the database, an instance of
SaveDogCommand is created with the necessary attributes and the method execute
is called.

An instance of this class has the same attributes as the class Dog in dog.py,
except for the id. We want the id to be something that is managed by the system,
i.e, the api will not ever generate an id for a dog added to the database.
The method execute, checks if there is a dog with same name already in the
data base, raising the AlreadyExists Exception when this is the case. If it is
not the case, it instantiates a Dog object with the given attributes and uses
the function save() from the dog class, to add the Dog object to the database.

Testing:

We use a fixture database to create a temporary database while testing.
"Fixtures are functions decorated with a @pytest.fixture decorator. They are
usually located inside conftest.py but they can be added to the actual test
files as well. These functions are executed by default before each test... The
autouse flag is set to True so that it's automatically used by default before
(and after) each test in the test suite."
In this case we use the fixture to create a environment variable "DATABASE_NAME"
with the path to the temporary database. The class Dog is implemented to take
this environment variable into consideration when it exists. Notice the fixture
takes care of deleting the file after the test.

If we do not use a fixture. We would need to manually manage the creation of a
test database, clear it and organize the tests in a meaninful way.

- test_add_dog() verifies that a Dog is created, added to the database, and
retrieved with the same attributes.
- test_add_dog_already_exists verifies if the AlreadyExists exception is
thrown when a Dog that is already in the database is added to it again.

2. DeleteDogByNameCommand

API request for deleting a dog works similar to saving a dog.
The instance of DeleteDogByNameCommand only has the to-be-deleted Dog's name.
The method execute makes sure to raise a NotFound exception in case no dog is
found to be deleted. It calls delete_by_name from the class Dog.

Testing:

- test_delete_dog_by_name() adds a dog to the database and calls
DeleteDogByNameCommand's execute(). No exception is raised meaning that the dog
was found in the DB. To make sure it is deleted, we try to get it with
get_by_name and check that the dog is not there anymore.

-test_delete_dog_by_name_not_found() checks that DeleteDogByNameCommand's
execute() raises NotFound in case the dog to be deleted is not in the database
